Hello,

Here is my completed assignment as requested! Initially I took my time with the assignment,
taking care to architect everything properly and document accordingly. However, I started running
out of time and had to take a few shortcuts. Namely, I added Kingfisher for the image downloads,
in order to properly handle scrolling edge cases with the table view, and I skipped doing things like
proper dependency injection and self sizing table view cells. In the end, Im still pretty happy with my
work and I hope that you will feel the same!

Thanks so much for the opportunity,
Adel
